# squash

This app consumes the GitHub API to display information and recent commit history for user's favorite repositories. It uses **Retrofit 2** for HTTP requests and **Gson** for JSON deserialization. The favorite repos are stored on a **Firebase** backend.

## How to run
You will need an up-to-date version of Android Studio and a phone running Android 5.0 (Marshmallow) or higher. After cloning the repo, just build and run the app - simple as that!

## TODO
* Docs
* Add sorting to repo and commit lists
